# <a name="plugin"></a> What is a Plugin?

A plugin is an external or internal dependcy (dll). The ABI (Application Binary Interface) is defined in <b>MinerPlugin</b> project and plugin developers must implement the following interfaces [IMinerPlugin](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/blob/e0f9b58b11e7a66cafa9841c5838eba83df233b5/src/Miners/MinerPlugin/IMinerPlugin.cs) and [IMiner](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/blob/e0f9b58b11e7a66cafa9841c5838eba83df233b5/src/Miners/MinerPlugin/IMiner.cs). This means that you create a new project inside Miners directory and implement all required functions from IMinerPlugin and IMiner interfaces. It is recommended that each one is in its own file (Plugin and Miner file).<br>

Each plugin project should implement at least 1 plugin. You can implement more, but good practice is to keep 1 plugin inside 1 project.<br>
<b>IMinerPlugin</b> is used for registering the plugin and there will be only 1 instance created. Its job is to give basic info such as name, UUID, version, etc.<br>
<b>IMiner</b> is the mandatory interface for all miners containing bare minimum functionalities and is being used as miner process instance created by IMinerPlugin.<br>

Bare minimum example of plugin is written in [Example Plugin](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/tree/e0f9b58b11e7a66cafa9841c5838eba83df233b5/src/Miners/ExamplePlugin) project. The [Plugin](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/blob/e0f9b58b11e7a66cafa9841c5838eba83df233b5/src/Miners/ExamplePlugin/ExamplePlugin.cs) file contains implementation of IMinerPlugin interface for registration and creation of the plugin instance. The [Miner](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/blob/e0f9b58b11e7a66cafa9841c5838eba83df233b5/src/Miners/ExamplePlugin/ExampleMiner.cs) file contains implementation of IMiner interface, providing required functionalities.

# <a name="toolkit"></a> What is MinerPluginToolkitV1 used for?

It is recommended to use <b>MinerPluginToolkitV1</b> as this will enable full integration with NiceHash Miner. It will save time developing it and enable implementation of additional advanced features. If you are writing a plugin we highly recommend that you use MinerPluginToolkitV1. All miner plugins that are developed by NiceHash miner dev team are using MinerPluginToolkitV1. For example you can check [GMiner Plugin](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/tree/e0f9b58b11e7a66cafa9841c5838eba83df233b5/src/Miners/GMiner).<br>
MinerPluginToolkitV1 also enables creation of <b>Background Services</b>, check out [Ethlargement plugin](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/tree/e0f9b58b11e7a66cafa9841c5838eba83df233b5/src/Miners/Ethlargement) for example.
